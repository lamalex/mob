# 1.4.0
- The list of commits included in a mob branch is now truncated to a maximum of 5 entries to prevent the need for scrolling up in order to see the latest included changes.
- Show more informative error message when `mob <cmd>` is run outside of a git repository.
- Add environment variable MOB_TIMER which allows setting a default timer duration for `mob start` and `mob timer` commands.
- Add automatic and manual co-author attribution. Mob will collect all
  committers from a WIP branch and add them as co-authors in the final
  WIP commit. Co-authors can be manually specified using `mob start --with
  "Tom Hanks <wilson@vb.sport> as tom, ...". Using `as` saves tom so next
  time you can `mob start --with "tom".

# 1.3.0
- The default `MOB_COMMIT_MESSAGE` now includes `[ci skip]` and `[skip ci]` so that all the typical CI systems (including Azure DevOps) will skip this commit.
- Add `--squash` option to `mob done` that corresponds to `--no-squash`.
- Fixes the default text to speech command on linux and osx.
- Removed `MOB_DEBUG` environment variable (has been deprecated for some time).

# 1.2.0
- Add environment variable `MOB_REQUIRE_COMMIT_MESSAGE` which you could set to true to require a commit message other than the default one.
- Fixes a bug where you could not run `mob start --branch feature-1` because feature-1 contained a dash.
- Fixes a bug which prevented the sound output of 'mob next' and 'moo' on windows

# 1.1.0
- Add optional `--no-squash` for `mob done` to keep commits from wip branch.
- Add environment variable `MOB_DONE_SQUASH` to configure the `mob done` behaviour. `MOB_DONE_SQUASH=false` is equal to passing flag `--no-squash`.
- Special thanks to @jbrains, @koeberlue, @gregor_riegler for making this release happen, obviously, in a remote mob session.

# 1.0.0
- BREAKING: `MOB_WIP_BRANCH_QUALIFIER_SEPARATOR` now defaults to '-'.
- BREAKING: `MOB_NEXT_STAY` now defaults to 'true'.
- Proposed cli commands like `mob start --include-uncommitted-changes` are now shown on a separate line to allow double clicking to copy in the terminal.

# 0.0.27
- Add way to configure `MOB_WIP_BRANCH_QUALIFIER` via an environment variable instead of `--branch` parameter. Helpful if multiple teams work on the same repository.
- Add way to configure `MOB_WIP_BRANCH_QUALIFIER_SEPARATOR` via an environment variable. Defaults to '/'. Will change to '-' in future versions to prevent branch naming conflicts (one cannot have a branch named `mob/main` and a branch named `mob/main/green` because `mob/main` cannot be a file and a directory at the same time).

# 0.0.26
- Adds way to configure the voice command via the environment variable `MOB_VOICE_COMMAND`.
- Allow disabling voice or notification by setting the environment variables `MOB_VOICE_COMMAND` or `MOB_NOTIFY_COMMAND` to an empty string.
- Fixes a bug where a failure in executing the voice command would lead to omitting the notification.
- `mob config` now shows the currently used `MOB_VOICE_COMMAND` and `MOB_NOTIFY_COMMAND`.
- Add `mob next --message "custom commit message"` as an option to override the commit message during `mob next`.

# 0.0.25
- Adds flag `--return-to-base-branch` (with shorthand `-r`) to return to base branch on `mob next`. Because 'mob' will change the default behavior from returning to the base branch to staying on the wip branch on `mob next`, this flag provides the inverse operation of `--stay`. If both are provided, the latter one wins.
- Adds flag `-i` as a shorthand notation for `--include-uncommitted-changes`.
- Fixes a bug that prevented `mob start` to work when on an outdated the WIP branch 
- `mob next` push if there are commits but no changes.

# 0.0.24
- Fixes a bug where mob couldn't handle branch names with the '/' character 

# 0.0.23
- Commit message of wip commits is no longer quoted (see #52)

# 0.0.22
- Adds `mob start --branch <branch>` to allow multiple wip branches in the form of 'mob/<base-branch>/<branch>' for a base branch. For example, when being on branch 'main' a `mob start --branch green` would switch to a wip branch named 'mob/main/green'.
- Adds `mob moo` (Thanks Niko for the idea)
- Deprecated `MOB_DEBUG` in favor of the parameter `--debug`
- Deprecated `MOB_START_INCLUDE_UNCOMMITTED_CHANGES` in favor of the parameter `--include-uncommitted-changes` instead
- Show warning if removed configuration option `MOB_BASE_BRANCH` or `MOB_WIP_BRANCH` is used.

# 0.0.20
- `mob start` on a branch named `feature1` will switch to the branch `mob/feature1` and will merge the changes back to `feature1` after `mob done`. For the `master` branch, the `mob-session` branch will still work (but this may change in the future, switching to `mob/master` at some point).
- Removes configuration options for base branch and wip branch. These are no longer necessary.
- `mob status` added. Thanks to Jeff Langr for that contribution! 

# 0.0.19
- Removes zoom screen share integration.
- Less git commands necessary for 'mob start'
- Mob automatically provides sound output on windows without any installation

# 0.0.18
- Fixes a bug where boolean environment variables such as `MOB_NEXT_STAY` set to any value (including empty value) falsely activated their respective option.
- Simplified `mob start` when joining a mob session. It uses `git checkout -B mob-session origin/mob-session` to override any local `mob-session` in the process. It reduces the amount of commands necessary and makes the mob tool more predictable: the `origin/mob-session` always contains the truth.
- Removes `mob share` command. You can still enable the zoom integration via `mob start 10 share` although this is now DEPRECATED and will eventually be removed in the future.

# 0.0.16
- `mob start` prints out untracked files as well 
- `mob start --include-uncommitted-changes` now includes untracked files in the stash 'n' pop as well 
- keying in an unknown command like `mob conf` will internally call `mob help` to print out the usage options instead of calling `mob status`
- fixed a bug where overriding `MOB_START_INCLUDE_UNCOMMITTED_CHANGES` via an environment variable could print out a wrong value (didn't affect any logic, just wrong console output)

# 0.0.15
- Any `git push` command now uses the `--no-verify` flag

# 0.0.14
- New homepage available at https://mob.sh
- `mob config` prints configuration using the environment variable names which allow overriding the values

# 0.0.13
- Fixes bug that prevented users wih git versions below 2.21 to be able to use 'mob'.
